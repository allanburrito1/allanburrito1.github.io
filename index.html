	<h2>Personal Information</h2>
	<p>Welcome to my very basic website for Assignment 1 for Intro to Information Technology.</p>
	<p>I was born at Wollongong hospital on September 6th 1988. My background is Serbian, coming from my mothers side and Portuguese, coming from my fathers side.<p>
	<p>Completed High School in 2006. Worked in a kitchen for almost 10 years. While working I completed a Graphic Design Diploma at Martin College in Sydney. After I completed it, still worked in kitchens and managed a fast food restuaraunt aswell doing freelance work whenever I could get some. Mostly logos, sign work and branding.</p>
	<p>I had an opportunity to work in Accounting. So i took it, I got sick of the kitchen and created a new path for my life I have been doing Accounting for almost 5 years got my Certificate IV in Accounting and I am two subjects away from getting my Diploma in Accounting. I study and complete the course during work hours so it does not interupt my studies for this course</p>
	<p>My hobbies and interests are playing video games. I have been playing games since I can remember and have enjoyed it throughout my adults years. I love our video games have grown up and matured and have become more of an art form then to just something that kids play.</p>
	<p>Another interest is Health and fitness I love going to the gym almost everyday. Its a good way to clear your head as much it is to getting fit.</p>
