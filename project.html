	<h1>Hello World!</h1>

	<p>Hello World! My name is Allan Ornelas.</p>
	<p>Student number s3778880.</p>
	<p>e-mail: allandurden1@gmail.com</p>
	
	<h2>Project Idea</h2>


	<p>I love going to the gym almost every day. I love slowly see my progression of running that extra 10 seconds then I did yesterday. That one more push. I love the feeling I get when I learn a new song on guitar that gratification you feel when start by playing it very slowly and you slowly get faster and faster. It is a universal feeling we all feel. We all feel great accomplishing anything.</p>

	<p>My project idea I would like to build is a mobile application on teaching how to code and also understanding it.</p>

	<p>While there are plenty of applications teaching you how to code, CodeAcademy, freeCodeCamp, ProgrammingHub.</p>

	<p>What they are is you do your first lesson, most likely Hello World! lesson. You move to your next lesson, the next lesson until you finish all your lessons and you “feel” accomplished but then you try to do it yourself and you do not know where to start.</p>

	<p>What my app will be is what people do to progress at a gym, progress to play guitar, progress to finish that level in a game.  What do people do, they keep trying, trying and trying until they get better and better and become ready to put heavier weights, learn a harder song, finally beat that level.</p>

	<p>A lot of people want to learn to code they see it’s the future of this crazy technological world we are living in. But we need to be honest with people and say you need to do it over and over and over again until you become comfortable to move on to the next challenge. It is not going to take a week or two to become a developer it will take time and effort to become what you want to become.</p>

	<p>How the app will work is, you want to learn HTML. You are a beginner at coding. So will teach you a project in HTML. A simple website with heading, paragraphs, images and list tags. You learn it, you feel good you feel accomplished.  The next day you will get a reminder to do the lesson again. You do it again. The next day another reminder you do it again. You keep doing it until you feel ready to do it yourself. You try it yourself you either build it yourself without any help or you still need help so you keep doing it until you are ready to progress. I think it’s a better way to get people into developing instead of getting a tutorial and they see its 3-5 hours they see how long it and just want to get through it.</p>

	<p>You can do whatever you want to get into. HTML, CSS JavaScript. You can set it up like a gym schedule. Monday can be HTML & CSS lesson. Tuesday is JavaScript lesson. Wednesday again its HTML & CSS. Thursday again is JavaScript lesson.</p>

	<p>It will be like your own personal trainer but for coding. You will be able to set a time of day of your choosing to remind you it’s time to learn.  This app isn’t about getting a certificate at the end of a course. This is about the reality of trying to progress in something you want to learn and that takes time and effort but even if it's just reminding you what you learned the previous day. It's your brain gathering that information and it's slowly progressing your knowledge.</p>

	<p>The app also wants to make people stay on the app after their lesson instead of them changing to social media that is not about coding. So we will build a forum section where people can ask question talk about project ideas. Build a blog section recommending people articles to read what podcast to listen to. Try to engage people in the world of code.</p>

	<p>I would want to build it first on iOS. Since it would be easier to build and design on a closed system. Meaning I am only designing and building for a few standardised devices and operating systems. Whereas Android is open source meaning more devices and a lack of standardisation. Even though Apple is a closed system doesn’t mean it will still be easy to design and build since Apple still have different phone sizes out in the world with the standard and plus sizes and with people still using iPhone 5 and also still using old operating systems on their phone.</p>

	<p>To build this app you can use apples free IDE Xcode. It uses the programming language swift which I will need to learn. Swift is based on Objective C language which I would love to learn as well. </p>

	<p>There is other things I will need to learn like the server side, which I will need to be using if we are going to get people to sign up and how to store their information. How to store the tutorials. How much will it cost what kind of service are we providing is it a monthly subscription, is it free with ads or pay a premium with no adds. I believe a monthly subscription is the best format to help with the cost. Give people a taste of the app first and then if they want the full app they will join with a monthly subscription.</p>

	<p>There will be many obstacles to build this app. But once built it will be a learning device that you can take anywhere. Someone will be able to learn at home or on the go. Gathering as much knowledge as they can every day so they can become successful in the world of code.</p>
