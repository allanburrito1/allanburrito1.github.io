	<h3 style="clear:both;">Meaning of the Results</h3>

		<p>The results of all three tests do not really surprise me since I know what type of person I am.</p>
		
		<p>The results of these tests that may influence my behaviour on a group project is that I would not be the first team memeber to offer to be the leader of the group I would listen to peoples ideas more than suggest an idea. I would do what I have to do and move on to the next thing that needs to be done.</p>
		
		<p>How I would take into account these results when forming a team is that I would be honest what type of person I am. I would ask my team to try to encourage me to speak my ideas. I will do what I have to do in order to help with the project.</p>
