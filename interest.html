	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<p>Hello World! My name is Allan Ornelas.</p>
	<p>Student number s3778880.</p>

	<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
	<p>I started becoming interest in IT when I did it as an elective in High School. After high school my interest for it was non existence and as previously stated before i started working in a kitchen.</p>
	<p>I had another interest in IT when doing my Graphic Design Diploma and one of the subject was to design and build a website for a small business. We used Dreamweaver to build the website since it was part of the Creative Cloud. I found the coding part very interesting out of the whole subject and dived deeper into code and started learning more about the world of code and how it was so much more then HTML5 and CSS, front end, back end all the different language a found it all interested and wanted to learn more</p>
	<p>But life sometimes gets in the way and my interest again was non existence once I started doing Accounting</p>
	<p>From when I first started to become interested in IT in high school in 2006 to when I did some coding in my Grahic Design Diploma in 2013 to now in 2019 alot has changed in the world of IT. More ways to learn about it with the internet becoming what it is today to smart phones and the Applications.</p>
	<p>I started watching tutorial videos on Udemy in 2018. I started with the very basics of HTML I tried to learn python becuase of how popoular it was in 2018, I mean python was googled more times then Kim Kardashian.</p>
	<p>I got over excited and downloaded so many tutorials didn't know what I really wanted when I was watching these tutorials. I was just watching and coding along with what they were doing and not really learning. I didn't know if i wanted to become a front end, back end web developer. Did I want to freelance and make websites for small business</p>
	<p>Call me old school but I learn better in an education environment. Weather it be on campus or online. I like deadlines it pushes me more to learn about the topic of the subject instead of watching a tutorial online and just doing it for the sake of doing it.</p>
	<p>I know i wanted to learn online since i enjoy doing my Diploma of Accounting online. Before I started to do a course online I had to decide what I really wanted to do with my new found passion of the world of IT.</p>
	<p>I believe with my skills in design and passion for video games I would love to be able to design and build video games I believe this course is the right track for it</p>
	<p>So I started looking around of what i could study and i came across Open Universities website i saw the course for Information Tecnology for RMIT, which offered alot of subjects i wanted to learn including Intro to Programming and Programming in C</p>
	<p>I dont expect to do these subjects and then all of a sudden say to myself "ok I have done these subjects now I know how to prgram". I understand that this is ever expanding world and to be involved in it everyday and learn something new everyday even if its only 20 minutes of learning something in a day it is still better than not learning anything at all. I understand i have to put in more effort outside this course and learn a skill that im passionionate about</p>
