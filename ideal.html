<p style="clear:both;">The job position would be about working in teams and developing video game prototyopes and help deliver the games to completion. The job appeals to me because its a program I really want to learn and that is Unity.</p>
<p>The main skills I would need to learn for this job is all the requirements that is needed in the "Requirements" sub heading, besisdes working in a team which I have experience with the Graphic Design Diploma course aswell managing a team at my current and previous jobs. I would need to learn.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Programming C# (Unity 3D)</li>
	<li>Game design</li>
	<li>GPU Programming</li>
	<li>SVN and GIT version-control</li>
	<li>Android and IOS development</li>
	<li>3D modeling / lighting / UV-mapping / texturing</li>
	<li>Experience in VR</li>
</ul>
<p>In the sub heading section of "What we're looking for:" I believe I have an keen eye for polish and detail due to my Design skills and ready to embrace new technologies and a passion for constantly making things better and mastering my craft.</p>
<p>I would start by learning how to program in C# and how to use Unity. The best way to learn Unity is by Unity themself. They offer tutorials, courses, documentation, training, certification and education</p>
<p>Also I would need to learn how game design principle and player experience work. I believe if I have an understanding how unity works the best way to learn this is learn by doing make something simple even if its a 2d game that jumos up and down. Evenutally getting more confident and building more complex games slowly but surely.</p>
